Data transfer between LHCb data acquisition system and FPGA accelerators <br/>
Franz Machado Supervised by Riccardo Fantechi <br/>
Abstract: In this work we review the data acquisition system used by the LHCb experiment and we perform a test on data transfer between PCIe40, EB and the RETINA buffer. We use a method that consists in merging two data streams that use a specific format into one data stream. This method could be more efficient and takes into account certain characteristics of the firmwares used in previous runs.
